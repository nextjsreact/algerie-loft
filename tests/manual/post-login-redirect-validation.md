# Post-Login Redirect Validation Report

## Test Summary
Date: $(Get-Date)
Feature: Post-login landing redirect with locale preservation
Status: ✅ PASSED

## Automated Tests Results

### Unit Tests
- ✅ Redirect to French dashboard when locale is 'fr'
- ✅ Redirect to English dashboard when locale is 'en' 
- ✅ Redirect to Arabic dashboard when locale is 'ar'
- ✅ Fallback to French dashboard when locale is invalid
- ✅ Fallback to French dashboard when locale is undefined
- ✅ Return error when login fails (no redirect)

**All 6 unit tests passed successfully**

## Implementation Verification

### Code Changes Made
1. ✅ **Login function updated** (`lib/auth.ts`)
   - Changed redirect from `/${validLocale}` to `/${validLocale}/dashboard`
   - Maintains locale validation with fallback to 'fr'

2. ✅ **Login form integration** (`components/auth/simple-login-form-nextintl.tsx`)
   - Already properly passes locale to login function
   - Uses `useLocale()` hook from next-intl

### URL Structure Validation
- **Before**: Login → `/` (root page)
- **After**: Login → `/{locale}/dashboard` (localized dashboard)

### Supported Locales
- ✅ French (`fr`) → `/fr/dashboard`
- ✅ English (`en`) → `/en/dashboard` 
- ✅ Arabic (`ar`) → `/ar/dashboard`
- ✅ Invalid/undefined → `/fr/dashboard` (fallback)
