# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Fix the hydration mismatch error caused by next-themes adding theme attributes to the HTML element after client-side hydration. The server renders HTML without theme attributes, but the client adds `className="light"` and `style={{color-scheme:"light"}}`, causing React hydration warnings.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the theme system to work without hydration mismatches, so that the application loads without console errors and maintains proper SSR/client consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN there SHALL be no hydration mismatch errors related to theme attributes
2. WHEN the server renders the HTML THEN the theme attributes SHALL match what the client expects
3. WHEN the theme changes THEN it SHALL work properly without breaking hydration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme to be applied consistently from the initial page load, so that there's no flash of unstyled content or theme switching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the correct theme SHALL be applied immediately without flashing
2. WHEN using system theme preference THEN it SHALL be detected and applied correctly on both server and client
3. WHEN the user has a saved theme preference THEN it SHALL be restored without hydration issues

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the theme provider to be properly configured for Next.js App Router, so that it works correctly with SSR and client-side navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the theme provider THEN it SHALL be compatible with Next.js App Router
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the theme SHALL persist correctly
3. WHEN the theme provider initializes THEN it SHALL not cause layout shifts or hydration warnings
