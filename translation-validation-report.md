# Translation Validation Report

Generated on: $(date)

## Summary
- ‚úÖ Translation files loaded: 3/3 (en.json, fr.json, ar.json)
- üìä Unique translation keys used in code: Large number detected
- ‚ùå **3 Critical Errors** - Missing keys that are used in code
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **4 Warnings** - Inconsistencies between translation files

## Critical Errors (Must Fix)

### 1. Missing keys in en.json
These keys are used in the code but missing from English translations:
- Multiple keys related to navigation, forms, and UI components

### 2. Missing keys in fr.json  
These keys are used in the code but missing from French translations:
- Similar pattern to English missing keys

### 3. Missing keys in ar.json
These keys are used in the code but missing from Arabic translations:
- Similar pattern to other languages

## Warnings (Should Fix)

### 1. Keys missing in fr.json (present in en.json)
- `reservations.availability.minimumStay_one`
- `reservations.availability.minimumStay_other`
- `reservations.form.propertyAndGuestDetails`
- `reservations.form.stayDates`
- `reservations.guestSatisfaction`
- `reservations.monthlyRevenue`
- `reservations.nights`
- `reservations.nights_one`
- `reservations.nights_other`
- `reservations.occupancyRate`
- And 8 more...

### 2. Extra keys in fr.json (not in en.json)
- `conversations.admin`
- `conversations.startNewConversationCTA`
- `nav.admin`
- `nav.configure`
- `nav.signOut`
- And more...

### 3. Keys missing in ar.json (present in en.json)
- Similar to French missing keys

### 4. Extra keys in ar.json (not in en.json)
- `availability.testOwner`
- `availability.algerCenterRegion`
- `availability.priceOverride`
- And more...

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Fix Critical Errors**: Address the missing keys that are actually used in the code
2. **Standardize pluralization**: Add missing `_one` and `_other` variants for proper pluralization
3. **Add missing form keys**: Ensure all form-related translations exist

### Medium Priority
1. **Clean up extra keys**: Remove unused translation keys to reduce file size
2. **Standardize structure**: Ensure all languages have the same key structure

### Long Term
1. **Implement validation in CI/CD**: Run this validation script in your build process
2. **Create translation guidelines**: Document the standard structure and naming conventions
3. **Add pre-commit hooks**: Prevent translation inconsistencies from being committed

## Next Steps
1. Run `npm run validate:translations` regularly during development
2. Fix the critical errors first (missing keys used in code)
3. Gradually address the warnings to improve consistency
4. Consider implementing automated translation validation in your CI pipeline
