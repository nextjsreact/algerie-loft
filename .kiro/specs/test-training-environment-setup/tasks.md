## PRODUCTI

ON SAFETY MEASURES

**CRITICAL SAFETY RULES:**

1. **PRODUCTION IS ALWAYS READ-ONLY**: Le système ne peut JAMAIS écrire, modifier ou supprimer des données en production
2. **DOUBLE VERIFICATION**: Chaque opération vérifie deux fois l'environnement cible avant exécution
3. **CONNECTION VALIDATION**: Toutes les connexions à la production sont automatiquement configurées en lecture seule
4. **OPERATION BLOCKING**: Blocage automatique de toute tentative d'écriture vers la production
5. **AUDIT ALERTS**: Alertes automatiques pour tout accès à la production

**IMPLEMENTATION SAFETY CHECKS:**

- Validation de l'environnement source (production = lecture seule uniquement)
- Validation de l'environnement cible (jamais la production)
- Vérification des permissions de base de données
- Confirmation utilisateur pour les opérations sensibles
- Logs de sécurité pour toutes les opérations

**EMERGENCY PROCEDURES:**

- Arrêt immédiat en cas de détection d'opération dangereuse
- Rollback automatique en cas d'erreur
- Alertes administrateur en cas de problème de sécurité
- Isolation automatique des environnements en cas de problème
