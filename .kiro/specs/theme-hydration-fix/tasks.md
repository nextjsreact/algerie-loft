# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix hydration mismatch in root layout

  - Add `suppressHydrationWarning` prop to the `<html>` element in `app/layout.tsx`
  - This will suppress the expected hydration warnings for theme attributes added by next-themes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 2. Verify theme provider configuration

  - Review and ensure ThemeProvider in `components/providers/client-providers-nextintl.tsx` has correct props
  - Confirm `attribute="class"`, `defaultTheme="system"`, `enableSystem`, and `disableTransitionOnChange` are set
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 3. Test hydration fix
  - Load the application and verify no hydration mismatch errors appear in console
  - Test theme switching functionality to ensure it still works correctly
  - Verify system theme detection works without hydration issues
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.3_

## Status: COMPLETED âœ…

All theme hydration issues have been resolved. The application now properly handles theme switching without hydration mismatches.
