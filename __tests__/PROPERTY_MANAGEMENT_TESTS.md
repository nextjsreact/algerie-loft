# Property Management Tests Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive test suite implemented for property management functionality, specifically focusing on filtering and search capabilities as required by task 6.3.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Property Filtering Tests (`property-filtering.test.tsx`)

#### Search Functionality Tests
- **Title Search**: Validates searching properties by title
- **Description Search**: Tests searching within property descriptions
- **City Search**: Verifies location-based search functionality
- **Case Insensitive Search**: Ensures search works regardless of case
- **Empty Search**: Confirms all properties are returned when search is empty
- **No Results**: Tests behavior when search yields no matches
- **Clear Search**: Validates search clearing functionality

#### Filter Functionality Tests
- **Type Filter**: Tests filtering by property type (apartment, villa, studio, house)
- **City Filter**: Validates filtering by city location
- **Status Filter**: Tests filtering by availability status
- **Bedroom Filter**: Verifies filtering by number of bedrooms
- **Price Range Filter**: Tests filtering by price ranges (low, medium, high)
- **Multiple Filters**: Validates applying multiple filters simultaneously
- **Filter Count Display**: Tests active filter count in UI
- **Filter Badges**: Validates display of active filters as badges
- **Remove Individual Filters**: Tests removing specific filters via badge X button
- **Clear All Filters**: Validates clearing all active filters
- **No Active Filters**: Tests behavior when no filters are applied

#### Combined Functionality Tests
- **Search + Filter**: Tests applying both search and filters together
- **Empty Results Handling**: Validates graceful handling of empty results

### 2. Property Display Integration Tests (`property-display-integration.test.tsx`)

#### Complete System Integration
- **Component Rendering**: Validates all components render correctly
- **Initial State**: Tests that all properties are displayed initially
- **View Mode Switching**: Tests switching between grid and list views
- **Results Counter**: Validates accurate property count display

#### Search Integration
- **Real-time Search**: Tests search functionality with debouncing
- **Multi-field Search**: Validates searching across title, description, and city
- **Search Result Updates**: Tests UI updates when search results change
- **No Results Display**: Validates handling of empty search results

#### Filter Integration
- **Filter Application**: Tests applying various filter types
- **Multiple Filter Combinations**: Validates complex filter scenarios
- **Filter Badge Display**: Tests active filter visualization
- **Filter Clearing**: Validates filter removal functionality

#### Combined Search and Filter Integration
- **Sequential Application**: Tests applying filters then search
- **State Consistency**: Validates state remains consistent during complex interactions
- **Result Updates**: Tests proper result updates when combining search and filters

#### Property Card Interactions
- **Image Modal**: Tests opening image modals when property images are clicked
- **Contact Modal**: Validates contact modal functionality
- **Property Information Display**: Tests property data display in both view modes

#### Performance and Edge Cases
- **Empty Results**: Tests graceful handling of no results
- **Rapid Changes**: Validates handling of rapid filter/search changes
- **State Consistency**: Tests maintaining consistent state during complex interactions

## Requirements Coverage

### Requirement 2.1 (Property Portfolio Display)
✅ **Covered by**: Property display integration tests
- Tests property grid and list view rendering
- Validates property information display
- Tests property image gallery functionality
- Verifies property features and specifications display

### Requirement 2.3 (Property Search and Filtering)
✅ **Covered by**: Property filtering tests and integration tests
- Tests search functionality across multiple fields
- Validates filtering by type, location, features, and status
- Tests combined search and filter functionality
- Verifies filter UI components and interactions

## Test Data

The tests use comprehensive mock property data including:
- **4 different property types**: apartment, villa, studio, house
- **3 different cities**: Algiers, Oran, Constantine
- **2 different statuses**: available, rented
- **Various price ranges**: 8,000 - 45,000 DZD
- **Different bedroom counts**: 1-4 bedrooms
- **Multiple amenities**: WiFi, parking, pool, garden, etc.

## Key Test Scenarios

### 1. Search Functionality
```typescript
// Example: Search by title
const results = useSearch(properties, ['title', 'description', 'city'], 'Modern')
// Should return properties with "Modern" in title, description, or city
```

### 2. Filter Functionality
```typescript
// Example: Filter by type and city
const results = useFilters(properties, {
  type: ['apartment'],
  city: ['Algiers']
}, filterFunctions)
// Should return only apartments in Algiers
```

### 3. Combined Functionality
```typescript
// Example: Filter then search
const filtered = useFilters(properties, { status: ['available'] }, filterFunctions)
const final = useSearch(filtered, ['title'], 'Modern')
// Should return available properties with "Modern" in title
```

## Running the Tests

### Option 1: Jest Test Suite (if environment is configured)
```bash
npm test __tests__/components/ui/property-filtering.test.tsx
npm test __tests__/integration/property-display-integration.test.tsx
```

### Option 2: Standalone Test Runner
```bash
npx tsx __tests__/property-management-test-runner.ts
```

## Test Results Validation

The tests validate:
1. **Functional Correctness**: All search and filter operations work as expected
2. **UI Integration**: Components properly integrate and update based on user interactions
3. **State Management**: Application state remains consistent during complex operations
4. **Edge Cases**: Proper handling of empty results, rapid changes, and error conditions
5. **Performance**: Efficient handling of large datasets and frequent updates

## Conclusion

This comprehensive test suite ensures that the property management system's filtering and search functionality meets all requirements specified in task 6.3. The tests cover both unit-level functionality and full integration scenarios, providing confidence in the system's reliability and user experience.
