# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for fixing the reservation system data consistency issue where test loft data is displayed to users but cannot be used for actual reservations due to foreign key constraints. The system currently shows test lofts when the database is empty but fails when users try to create reservations with these test loft IDs, causing foreign key constraint violations.

## Glossary

- **Reservation_System**: The complete booking system handling loft reservations
- **Test_Data_Handler**: Component managing fallback test data when database is empty
- **Database_Seeder**: System component that populates the database with initial loft data
- **Foreign_Key_Constraint**: Database constraint ensuring loft_id references exist in lofts table
- **Data_Consistency**: State where all displayed lofts can be successfully reserved
- **Loft_Repository**: Data access layer for loft information
- **Reservation_Repository**: Data access layer for reservation operations
- **Test_Environment**: Development/testing setup requiring consistent test data

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer testing the reservation flow, I want the system to have consistent test data, so that I can create reservations for any loft displayed in the search results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the lofts table is empty, THE Database_Seeder SHALL populate it with the same test lofts used by the search API
2. WHEN a user views loft search results, THE Loft_Repository SHALL ensure all displayed lofts exist in the database
3. WHEN a user attempts to create a reservation, THE Reservation_System SHALL verify the loft_id exists before processing
4. THE Test_Data_Handler SHALL maintain consistency between search results and reservation capabilities
5. THE Database_Seeder SHALL create lofts with the exact same IDs used in the test data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of the test reservation flow, I want to successfully complete reservations for any loft I can see, so that I can test the complete booking process without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a loft from search results, THE Reservation_System SHALL accept the loft_id for reservation creation
2. WHEN I submit a reservation form, THE Reservation_Repository SHALL successfully create the reservation without foreign key errors
3. IF a loft_id is invalid, THE Reservation_System SHALL provide a clear error message before attempting database insertion
4. THE Reservation_System SHALL validate loft availability and existence before processing payment information
5. WHEN a reservation is created successfully, THE Reservation_System SHALL return complete booking confirmation details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database to be automatically seeded with test data when empty, so that the application works correctly in development and testing environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts and the lofts table is empty, THE Database_Seeder SHALL automatically insert test loft data
2. THE Database_Seeder SHALL use the same loft data structure and IDs as the fallback test data in the search API
3. WHEN seeding data, THE Database_Seeder SHALL include all required fields for successful reservation creation
4. THE Database_Seeder SHALL set appropriate default values for loft status, availability, and pricing information
5. THE Database_Seeder SHALL log successful seeding operations for debugging and monitoring

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test loft data to be centralized and consistent across all APIs, so that changes to test data don't break the reservation flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Test_Data_Handler SHALL define test loft data in a single, shared location
2. WHEN the search API needs test data, THE Test_Data_Handler SHALL provide the same data used for database seeding
3. WHEN the reservation API validates loft existence, THE Test_Data_Handler SHALL ensure consistency with search results
4. THE Test_Data_Handler SHALL include all fields required by both search and reservation operations
5. THE Test_Data_Handler SHALL maintain data format compatibility across different API endpoints

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages when reservation issues occur, so that I understand what went wrong and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a loft_id doesn't exist, THE Reservation_System SHALL return a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN database constraints are violated, THE Reservation_System SHALL translate technical errors into understandable messages
3. THE Reservation_System SHALL validate all required data before attempting database operations
4. WHEN validation fails, THE Reservation_System SHALL specify which fields are missing or invalid
5. THE Reservation_System SHALL provide suggestions for resolving common reservation errors

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system, I want to maintain data integrity while supporting both test and production environments, so that the reservation system works reliably in all contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Database_Seeder SHALL only seed test data in development and testing environments
2. THE Reservation_System SHALL handle both real and test loft data seamlessly
3. WHEN in production mode, THE Database_Seeder SHALL not override existing loft data
4. THE Test_Data_Handler SHALL provide environment-appropriate data management
5. THE Reservation_System SHALL maintain the same API interface regardless of data source

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer debugging reservation issues, I want comprehensive logging of data operations, so that I can quickly identify and resolve problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Reservation_System SHALL log all loft_id validation attempts and results
2. WHEN database operations fail, THE Reservation_System SHALL log detailed error information including constraint violations
3. THE Database_Seeder SHALL log all seeding operations with timestamps and affected records
4. THE Test_Data_Handler SHALL log when fallback test data is used instead of database data
5. THE Reservation_System SHALL log successful reservation creation with all relevant details

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want the reservation flow to work consistently across different test scenarios, so that I can validate the complete user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing with an empty database, THE Reservation_System SHALL automatically provide working test lofts
2. WHEN testing reservation creation, THE Reservation_System SHALL successfully process all displayed lofts
3. THE Test_Data_Handler SHALL provide diverse test scenarios including different loft types and price ranges
4. WHEN running automated tests, THE Reservation_System SHALL provide predictable and repeatable test data
5. THE Reservation_System SHALL support testing of both successful reservations and error conditions

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the loft and reservation data models to be properly synchronized, so that all system components work together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Database_Seeder SHALL create loft records with all fields required by the reservation system
2. THE Loft_Repository SHALL provide data in the format expected by the Reservation_Repository
3. WHEN loft data is updated, THE Reservation_System SHALL reflect changes in pricing and availability
4. THE Test_Data_Handler SHALL maintain schema compatibility between test and production data
5. THE Reservation_System SHALL validate data model consistency before processing reservations

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want the reservation system to provide a smooth user experience from search to booking confirmation, so that users can successfully complete their reservations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Reservation_System SHALL ensure that every loft shown in search results can be successfully reserved
2. WHEN users progress through the booking flow, THE Reservation_System SHALL maintain data consistency at each step
3. THE Reservation_System SHALL provide immediate feedback if a selected loft becomes unavailable
4. WHEN reservation creation succeeds, THE Reservation_System SHALL provide complete confirmation details
5. THE Reservation_System SHALL handle edge cases gracefully without exposing technical errors to users
