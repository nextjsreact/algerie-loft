# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The availability management page is currently displaying duplicate content, showing the entire "Gestion des Disponibilités" form twice. This creates a confusing user experience and indicates an underlying component rendering issue that needs to be resolved.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a property manager, I want to see only one availability management form on the page, so that I can manage my property availability without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the availability management page THEN the system SHALL display exactly one "Gestion des Disponibilités" form
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL NOT render duplicate form elements
3. WHEN I interact with form controls THEN the system SHALL respond to only one set of controls

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and fix the root cause of component duplication, so that similar issues don't occur in other parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN investigating the component structure THEN the system SHALL reveal the cause of duplicate rendering
2. WHEN the fix is applied THEN the system SHALL prevent similar duplication issues in related components
3. WHEN the page renders THEN the system SHALL maintain all original functionality without duplication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the availability form to display all translation keys properly, so that I can understand all form labels and messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the form THEN the system SHALL display translated text instead of raw translation keys like "reservations.availability.minimumStay"
2. WHEN the form loads THEN the system SHALL show proper French translations for all form elements
3. WHEN translation keys are missing THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful fallback text
