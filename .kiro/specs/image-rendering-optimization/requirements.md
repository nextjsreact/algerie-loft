# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses image blur and rendering quality issues in carousel components and other image-heavy UI elements. The system must deliver crisp, high-quality image rendering across different devices and browsers while maintaining smooth animations and transitions.

## Glossary

- **Image_Rendering_System**: The collection of components, hooks, and CSS optimizations responsible for displaying images with optimal quality
- **Carousel_Component**: Interactive image slider components including LoftCarousel, GentleFadeCarousel, and SmoothSlideCarousel
- **CSS_Transform_Blur**: Visual degradation of images caused by CSS transformations, scaling, or animation properties
- **Rendering_Pipeline**: The browser's process of displaying images from loading to final pixel rendering
- **Image_Optimization_Layer**: System responsible for image format selection, sizing, and delivery optimization

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see crisp, high-quality images in carousels and galleries, so that I can properly evaluate the visual content without distraction from blurry or pixelated images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is displayed in any carousel component, THE Image_Rendering_System SHALL render the image without visible blur or pixelation
2. WHILE CSS animations or transforms are active on image containers, THE Image_Rendering_System SHALL maintain image sharpness and clarity
3. IF an image undergoes scaling or positioning changes, THEN THE Image_Rendering_System SHALL preserve original image quality
4. WHERE high-resolution displays are detected, THE Image_Rendering_System SHALL deliver appropriately scaled images for optimal clarity
5. THE Image_Rendering_System SHALL apply rendering optimizations that eliminate blur caused by subpixel positioning

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent image rendering solution across all carousel variants, so that I can ensure uniform quality without duplicating optimization code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Image_Rendering_System SHALL provide a unified approach for image quality optimization across all carousel components
2. WHEN implementing new image components, THE Image_Rendering_System SHALL automatically apply rendering optimizations
3. THE Image_Rendering_System SHALL expose configuration options for different rendering scenarios
4. WHERE browser-specific rendering issues exist, THE Image_Rendering_System SHALL implement targeted fixes
5. THE Image_Rendering_System SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing image components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor using different devices and browsers, I want consistent image quality regardless of my viewing environment, so that the visual experience remains professional and polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the site from different browsers, THE Image_Rendering_System SHALL deliver consistent image quality
2. WHILE viewing on mobile devices with varying pixel densities, THE Image_Rendering_System SHALL adapt image rendering for optimal clarity
3. IF the browser supports advanced rendering features, THEN THE Image_Rendering_System SHALL utilize them for enhanced quality
4. THE Image_Rendering_System SHALL detect and compensate for browser-specific rendering quirks
5. WHERE performance constraints exist, THE Image_Rendering_System SHALL balance quality with rendering speed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want image quality improvements that don't negatively impact page loading or animation smoothness, so that the enhanced visuals don't compromise the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Image_Rendering_System SHALL implement quality improvements without degrading animation performance
2. WHEN applying rendering optimizations, THE Image_Rendering_System SHALL maintain 60fps animation targets
3. WHILE loading high-quality images, THE Image_Rendering_System SHALL provide smooth progressive enhancement
4. IF rendering optimizations impact performance, THEN THE Image_Rendering_System SHALL provide fallback options
5. THE Image_Rendering_System SHALL minimize additional CSS and JavaScript overhead from quality improvements
