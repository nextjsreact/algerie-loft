# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The internet connections settings page currently has 404 errors when trying to access individual connection types via dynamic routes. Users can see a list of internet connection types and there are edit buttons that attempt to navigate to individual connection pages, but these routes don't exist, resulting in 404 errors. The form component (`InternetConnectionTypeForm`) already exists and is properly migrated to next-intl, but the route structure is missing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to view and edit individual internet connection types, so that I can manage connection details effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks an edit button on an internet connection type THEN the system SHALL navigate to a dedicated edit page for that connection
2. WHEN a user accesses `/[locale]/settings/internet-connections/[id]` THEN the system SHALL display the existing `InternetConnectionTypeForm` component with the connection data pre-filled
3. IF the connection ID does not exist THEN the system SHALL display a 404 error page
4. WHEN a user successfully updates a connection type THEN the system SHALL redirect back to the main internet connections list

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to create new internet connection types, so that I can add new connection options to the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses `/[locale]/settings/internet-connections/new` THEN the system SHALL display the existing `InternetConnectionTypeForm` component in create mode
2. WHEN a user submits a valid new connection form THEN the system SHALL create the connection and redirect to the list
3. WHEN a user submits an invalid form THEN the system SHALL display validation errors
4. WHEN a user cancels the creation process THEN the system SHALL redirect back to the main list

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want consistent navigation and UI patterns, so that the internet connections management follows the same patterns as other settings sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the internet connections section THEN the system SHALL follow the same URL structure as other settings sections (payment-methods, currencies, etc.)
2. WHEN using forms THEN the system SHALL use consistent form components and validation patterns
3. WHEN displaying success/error messages THEN the system SHALL use the same toast notification system
4. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent breadcrumb and navigation patterns
