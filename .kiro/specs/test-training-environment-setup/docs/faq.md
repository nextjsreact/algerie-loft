# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) - Environment Management System

## General Questions

### Q: What is the Test/Training Environment Setup System?
**A:** The Test/Training Environment Setup System is an automated solution that creates safe, isolated environments that mirror production data and functionality. It allows developers, trainers, and administrators to work with realistic data without risking production systems.

### Q: How does the system protect production data?
**A:** The system implements multiple layers of protection:
- **Read-only production access**: Production is always accessed in read-only mode
- **Multiple safety checks**: Several validation steps before any operation
- **Automatic blocking**: Any write operations to production are automatically blocked
- **Audit logging**: All production access is logged and monitored
- **Data anonymization**: All sensitive data is anonymized in cloned environments

### Q: What types of environments can I create?
**A:** You can create several types of environments:
- **Test environments**: For development and testing with anonymized production data
- **Training environments**: For user training with sample data and scenarios
- **Development environments**: For local development work
- **Staging environments**: For pre-production testing

### Q: How long does it take to clone an environment?
**A:** Clone times vary based on data size:
- **Small databases** (< 1GB): 15-30 minutes
- **Medium databases** (1-10GB): 1-3 hours
- **Large databases** (10-100GB): 3-12 hours
- **Very large databases** (> 100GB): 12+ hours

## Technical Questions

### Q: What database systems are supported?
**A:** Currently, the system supports:
- **Primary**: Supabase (PostgreSQL-based)
- **Planned**: Direct PostgreSQL support
- **Future**: MySQL, MongoDB support

### Q: Can I clone specific tables or schemas?
**A:** Yes, you can:
```bash
# Clone specific tables
npm run clone --source=production --target=test --tables=users,transactions,lofts

# Clone specific schemas
npm run clone --source=production --target=test --schemas=public,audit

# Exclude certain tables
npm run clone --source=production --target=test --exclude-tables=large_logs,temp_data
```

### Q: How does data anonymization work?
**A:** The system uses configurable anonymization rules:
- **Email addresses**: Converted to `user{hash}@test.local`
- **Names**: Replaced with realistic fake names using faker.js
- **Phone numbers**: Replaced with fake numbers maintaining format
- **Financial data**: Replaced with realistic amounts within appropriate ranges
- **Relationships**: All foreign key relationships are preserved

### Q: Can I customize anonymization rules?
**A:** Yes, you can create custom anonymization rules:
```json
{
  "tableName": "customers",
  "columnName": "email",
  "anonymizationType": "email",
  "customGenerator": "customer-{index}@training.local"
}
```

### Q: What happens if a clone operation fails?
**A:** The system provides several recovery options:
- **Automatic retry**: Failed operations can be automatically retried
- **Resume from checkpoint**: Operations can resume from the last successful checkpoint
- **Rollback**: Complete rollback to the state before the operation
- **Partial recovery**: Fix specific issues and continue

### Q: How do I monitor clone operations?
**A:** You can monitor operations in several ways:
```bash
# Check operation status
npm run status --operation=<operation-id>

```

## Usage Questions

### Q: How do I switch between environments?
**A:** Use the environment switching command:
```bash
# Switch to test environment
npm run switch --environment=test

# Check current environment

# Switch back to development
npm run switch --environment=development
```

### Q: Can multiple people use the same test environment?
**A:** Yes, but consider:
- **Coordination**: Multiple users may interfere with each other's work
- **Data consistency**: Changes by one user affect others
- **Best practice**: Create separate environments for different teams or projects

### Q: How do I reset a test environment?
**A:** You can reset environments in several ways:
```bash
# Complete reset to original state
npm run reset --environment=test --full-reset

# Reset specific data
npm run reset --environment=test --data-only

# Reset to specific backup
npm run reset --environment=test --to-backup=<backup-id>
```

### Q: Can I create custom training scenarios?
**A:** Yes, you can create custom training scenarios:
```bash
# Create custom scenario
npm run training:create-scenario --name="Advanced Reservations" --config=scenario-config.json

# Apply scenario to training environment
npm run training:apply-scenario --environment=training --scenario="Advanced Reservations"
```

## Administrative Questions

### Q: How do I manage user access to environments?
**A:** Access is managed through role-based permissions:
```bash
# Grant clone permissions
npm run permissions:grant --user=developer@company.com --role=cloner

# List user permissions
npm run permissions:list --user=developer@company.com

# Revoke permissions
npm run permissions:revoke --user=user@company.com --role=cloner
```
